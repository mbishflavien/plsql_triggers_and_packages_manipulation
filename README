PL/SQL Triggers and Packages Manipulation
Repository: plsql_triggers_and_packages_manipulation

This project contains all the work I did while practicing PL/SQL triggers and package creation in Oracle. It includes different scripts for creating triggers, packages, and testing how they behave when data is inserted, updated, or deleted. The goal of the repository is to show practical understanding of how triggers and packages work in a real database environment.

Content
Triggers folder: contains all trigger scripts (before insert, after update, validation triggers, etc.)
Package folder: contains package specifications and package bodies
Screenshots folder: optional screenshots showing the execution or results

## What the project covers

-Basic and intermediate PL/SQL triggers

-How triggers enforce rules or automate tasks

-How packages group related procedures and functions

-How triggers can call procedures from packages

-Error handling, validations, and logic separation

**How to run the scripts

Connect to Oracle SQL Developer or SQL*Plus using the correct user.

Run the table creation scripts if needed.

Run the package specification and body.

Run the trigger scripts.

Test by inserting, updating, or deleting data.

Check the results or logs depending on the type of trigger.

Notes

Some scripts depend on each other, so run them in order.

Make sure the user has the right permissions to create triggers and packages.

If the trigger does not fire, check if there are conditions preventing it.

You can edit or extend the scripts based on your own logic.

Purpose
The repository mainly serves as practice material for PL/SQL. It shows how triggers and packages interact inside an Oracle database and helps build experience for DBMS courses or future backend/database work.
